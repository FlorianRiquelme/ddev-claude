## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Whitelist approach over blacklist: Safer default — block everything, allow known-good
- iptables over proxy: Simpler, no SSL interception needed, sufficient for domain-level
- Guidance over enforcement for file rules: User mounts their own Claude config, we warn but don't manage
- Global + per-project config: Teams need shared defaults, projects need overrides

### Pending Todos
