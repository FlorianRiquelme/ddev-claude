<objective>
Claude /whitelist skill for firewall-aware assistance

Purpose: Create a Claude skill that gives Claude awareness of the firewall environment, teaches it to detect blocked requests, and enables it to help users manage the whitelist by suggesting domains and editing configs after confirmation.

Output:
- /whitelist SKILL.md with firewall context and instructions
- Updated install.yaml to copy skill files to project

# Firewall Whitelist Management

You are running inside a ddev-claude container with a network firewall. Outbound traffic is blocked by default, and only whitelisted domains are allowed.

## Environment

- **Global config:** `~/.ddev/ddev-claude/whitelist.json`
- **Project config:** `/var/www/html/.ddev/ddev-claude/whitelist.json`
- **Default domains:** `/var/www/html/.ddev/claude/config/default-whitelist.json`
- **Hot reload:** Config changes apply automatically in 2-3 seconds

## Detecting Blocked Requests

When you see errors like:
- "Connection refused"
- "Could not resolve host"
- "Network is unreachable"
- "Connection timed out"

Check for blocked requests:
```bash
dmesg | grep '\[FIREWALL-BLOCK\]' | tail -10
```

Extract blocked IPs and attempt reverse DNS:
```bash
/var/www/html/.ddev/claude/scripts/parse-blocked-domains.sh
```

## Adding Domains to Whitelist

**ALWAYS ask for user confirmation before editing whitelist files.**

1. Explain why the domain is needed:
   - "I need access to api.example.com to fetch the API documentation"
   - "registry.npmjs.org is required for npm package installation"

2. Ask which config to use:
   - **Global config** for common tools (npm, composer, github)
   - **Project config** for project-specific APIs

3. After confirmation, add the domain:
```bash
# Read current domains
current=$(jq -r '.[]' ~/.ddev/ddev-claude/whitelist.json 2>/dev/null)

# Add new domain and write back
echo -e "$current\nnew-domain.com" | sort -u | grep -v '^$' | \
  jq -R -s 'split("\n") | map(select(length > 0))' > ~/.ddev/ddev-claude/whitelist.json
```

4. Confirm reload (happens automatically):
   - "Domain added. Hot reload will apply in 2-3 seconds."

## Removing Domains

```bash
# Remove a domain from project config
jq 'map(select(. != "domain-to-remove.com"))' \
  /var/www/html/.ddev/ddev-claude/whitelist.json > /tmp/whitelist.json && \
  mv /tmp/whitelist.json /var/www/html/.ddev/ddev-claude/whitelist.json
```

## Viewing Current Whitelist

Only show whitelist when explicitly asked. Don't proactively display it.

```bash
# Show merged whitelist (default + global + project)
/var/www/html/.ddev/claude/scripts/merge-whitelist.sh
```

## Stack Templates

When you detect a project type, offer to add common domains.

**Detection:**
- Laravel: `artisan` file + `composer.json` with `laravel/framework`
- npm: `package.json` exists

**Templates available at:**
- Laravel: `/var/www/html/.ddev/claude/config/stack-templates/laravel.json`
- npm: `/var/www/html/.ddev/claude/config/stack-templates/npm.json`

**Offer:**
"This appears to be a Laravel project. Would you like me to add the Laravel stack domains (packagist.org, repo.packagist.org)?"

To add a stack template:
```bash
# Merge stack template with project config
jq -s 'add | unique' \
  /var/www/html/.ddev/claude/config/stack-templates/laravel.json \
  /var/www/html/.ddev/ddev-claude/whitelist.json > /tmp/merged.json && \
  mv /tmp/merged.json /var/www/html/.ddev/ddev-claude/whitelist.json
```

## Wildcard Domains

Wildcards are supported: `*.example.com` matches all subdomains.

Note: Wildcards are resolved at firewall level. Each subdomain must be resolvable via DNS.

## Troubleshooting

**Check if firewall is active:**
```bash
iptables -L OUTPUT -n | head -5
```

**Check current ipset entries:**
```bash
ipset list whitelist_ips | tail -20
```

**Check watcher process:**
```bash
ps aux | grep watch-config
```

## Important Rules

1. **Always ask before editing** - Never modify whitelist.json without explicit user approval
2. **Explain domain purpose** - Tell users why each domain is needed
3. **Prefer project config** for project-specific APIs, global for common tools
4. **Don't proactively show whitelist** - Only display when asked
5. **Confirm success** - Tell users when domains are added and that hot reload is automatic
```

Key points from CONTEXT.md:
- Always asks for confirmation before editing
- Explains why domains are needed
- Smart default for target (project vs global)
- Can add and remove domains
- Offers stack templates
- Only shows status when asked

  <name>Task 2: Update install.yaml to include skill files</name>
  <files>install.yaml</files>
  <action>
Read the current install.yaml and add:

1. Copy skill files during installation:
```yaml
project_files:
  - source: claude/skills/whitelist/SKILL.md
    destination: .ddev/ddev-claude/skills/whitelist/SKILL.md
```

2. Add a post-install hook to create the skills directory if not using project_files:
Or use the pre_install_actions to copy skills.

The install.yaml structure for DDEV addons uses:
- `project_files:` to copy files from addon to project
- `pre_install_actions:` for commands before install
- `post_install_actions:` for commands after install

Add to install.yaml:
```yaml
project_files:
  - source: claude/skills/
    destination: .ddev/ddev-claude/skills/
```

This ensures the skill is available in the project's .ddev directory where Claude can access it.

Also add the commands directory:
```yaml
  - source: commands/
    destination: .ddev/commands/
```

Note: Check if install.yaml already has project_files section and merge appropriately.
